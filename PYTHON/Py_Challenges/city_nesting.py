# Python 2.7

# Directions:
    # Make a dictionary called favorite_cities.
    # Think of three names to use as keys (or ask three real people),
    # and store at least one favorite city for each person.
    # Finally, loop through the dictionary, then print each person's name
    # and their favorite cities.

# To help you get started...
favorite_cities = {
    'key1': ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'],
    'key2': ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'],
    'key3': ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'],
    }
# Now loop through the dictionary to relay the dictionary's data
# Look to the example on the favorite languages poll
# Here's the first line to help you get started
for name, cities in favorite_cities.items():

# Example from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes

# Let's look at the favorite languages poll example we did in class...
# Showing similar objects in a dictionary, with a nested list to show more than one favorite lang
# where we look at a poll taken from a population for favorite programming languages
# This will be VERY similar to the favorite_cities dictionary

# To see the code below run, just take out the comments on each line (be careful of indentation).

#favorite_languages = {
#  'jen': ['python', 'ruby'],
#  'sarah': ['c'],
#  'edward': ['ruby', 'go'],
#  'phil': ['python', 'haskell'],
#  }
#
#for name, languages in favorite_languages.items():
#    print("\n" + name.title() + "'s favorite languages are:")
#    for language in languages:
#        print("\t" + language.title())
