# What is API  

Application program interfaces (API) are used to pull, or retrieve data from remote websites. In order to use an API, you make a *request* to a remote web server. You **only retrieve the data you need**; rather than scraping the whole website. When you pull from a *live* site, you ensure the data you use is up-to-date.  

Instead of asking your web browser to display a webpage, you write a program that asks for the webpage data. This data returned is usually in the format, **JSON** or with comma-separated values (**CSV**).
