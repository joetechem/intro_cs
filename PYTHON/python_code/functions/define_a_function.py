# Let's take a look at our greeter.py file on user input..
# but, we define a function to perform the same task.

def greet_user():
    """Display a simple greeting."""
    print("Hello User!")

# So, we have defined our function. Let's use it by CALLING the name of it
greet_user()

# This example is one of the most simplest forms of a function.

# The first line use the keyword "def" to let Python know we are defining a function.
# The following parentheses display what information the function needs
# to complete the task (if relevant). For our case, we don't need it, so it's empty.
# Either way, the parentheses are required!!!
# Lastly, we end the function definition with a colon.

# BLOCKS OF CODE
# We should already be familiar with these; remember, loop function we've already used
# Any indented lines that come after the defined function, make up the "body" of the function.

# The triple quotes ("DOCSTRING") can be used to explain to any passerby, the task
# this function is trying to do. The docstring is essentially a comment, so Python ignores it.
