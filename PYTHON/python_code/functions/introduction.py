# In this directory, we'll go over how to write functions
# MAIN IDEA: Stay DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
# Functions are named blocks of code that do a specifi job.
# If you started out your programming adventures with Lightbot, think of procedures.

# When you want to perform a particular task, define a function that would complete that task.
# To actually complete the task, "call" the name of that function.

# Sometimes, you'll find that you need to perform this task more than once. Luckily,
# you don't need to type all the code for the task again and again. Phew!
# All you do is call the name of the function again.

# When you use functions, your programs will be easier to write, read, test, and fix.

# We will also learn ways to pass information to functions.
# We'll write certain functions whos main goal is to SHOW data (or information).
# We'll write functions designed to PROCESS data and return a value or set of values.
# Then, we'll learn how to store functions in separate files we can use across programs,
# recall the turtle module. This will help us organize our programs.
